# nlin-garch-and-1f-noise

Java program (and its source code) used to produce results, which are presented in the paper "Nonlinear GARCH model and 1/f noise" (A. Kononovicius, J. Ruseckas, Physica A 427, 2015, pp. 74-81, doi: [10.1016/j.physa.2015.02.040](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2015.02.040)).

Anyone may use this program or its source code for any purpose as long as the paper appropriately is referenced.
